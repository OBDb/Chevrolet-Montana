    description: "The original Chevrolet Montana (sold as the Tornado in some markets like Mexico) was a small unibody pickup truck developed primarily for Latin American markets. Based on the Opel Corsa/Chevrolet Corsa platform, it featured a front-wheel drive layout with a transverse engine, unusual for a pickup truck. Available only in a single cab configuration with a short bed, it was powered by small displacement engines typically ranging from 1.4L to 1.8L depending on the market. The interior was basic and car-like, sharing many components with the Corsa. This generation established the Montana as an economical, light-duty urban pickup for markets where small, affordable commercial vehicles were in demand, particularly Brazil and other South American countries."

    description: "The second-generation Montana was based on the Chevrolet Agile platform, an evolution of the previous generation's architecture. It maintained the front-wheel drive, unibody construction but featured more modern styling with a more prominent grille and sculptured body lines. Still available only as a single cab, it offered improved cargo capacity and slightly more interior space. Powertrain options remained focused on economy with engines ranging from 1.4L to 1.8L depending on the market. The interior saw upgrades in design and technology, though it remained relatively basic compared to passenger cars of the same era. This generation continued to serve primarily as an affordable, efficient utility vehicle for small businesses and as a lifestyle vehicle for buyers who occasionally needed cargo-carrying capability without the size and cost of a traditional pickup."

    description: "The current Montana represents a significant departure from its predecessors, evolving from a small car-based pickup to a more substantial compact unibody truck similar in concept to the Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz. Built on GM's GEM (Global Emerging Markets) platform shared with the Chevrolet Tracker SUV, it features a four-door crew cab designâ€”a first for the Montana nameplate. The exterior design incorporates modern Chevrolet styling elements with a more rugged appearance suitable for its pickup classification. Power comes from a 1.2L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing approximately 133 HP, paired with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission, maintaining a front-wheel drive layout. The interior is significantly more advanced than previous generations, featuring a standard 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument display options, and contemporary safety technology. The cargo bed, while compact, offers innovative storage solutions and a multi-position tailgate. This generation transforms the Montana from a basic utility vehicle to a more versatile lifestyle pickup that balances passenger comfort with practical cargo capabilities, primarily targeting Latin American markets but with potential for wider global distribution."
